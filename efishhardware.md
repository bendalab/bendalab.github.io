# Hard- and software for electric fish research

We are developing hard- and software for

- fishfinder
- EOD loggers
- electrode arrays

to make research on electric fish in the field more fun.

For more details see the following projects, amplifiers, and libraries:


## Teensy_Amp

A two-channel differential amplifier with band-pass filter settings.

[github](https://github.com/muchaste/Teensy_Amp) |
[janscience fork](https://github.com/janscience/Teensy_Amp)


## TeeRec - Teensy recorder

Libraries for recording analog input data on Teensy 3.2/3.5/3.6
microcontrollers.

[github](https://github.com/janscience/TeeRec) - available via [Arduino
Library Manager](https://github.com/arduino/library-registry).


## ESensors

A library for environmental sensors (air and water) for Teensy and
Arduino with additional background information.

[github](https://github.com/janscience/ESensors) - available via [Arduino Library Manager](https://github.com/arduino/library-registry).


## EOD-Logger

Teensy based recording devices for 2-4 channel electric signals from
weakly electric fish.

## FishFinder

Smart fishfinders for better EOD recordings of electric fish in the field.

## TeeGrid

Record electric fish with electrode arrays based on Teensy
microcontrollers.

[github](https://github.com/janscience/TeeGrid)


## fishgrid

C++ program running on Linux for recording data from our 64-electrode
grid used in Panama and Colombia. No longer maintained.
